## Mini System

This project aimed to achieve a small framework in PHP language from scratch.
The ideia is development from scratch everything that a developer needs to make a profissional project without
using any famous framework from market.

My mini-system is a way I found to study how real frameworks really work under the hood, and I've been created along of my
programmer development, mainly in the beggining for learning purposes and it was not thought to be commercialized or anything like that.

Many classes I created to understand how works, how to do and was designed in order to obtain flexibility and modularized systems easily.

An example of an implementation using this mini framework is:
